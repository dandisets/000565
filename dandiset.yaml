description: 'These datasets are part of an effort to understand C. elegans whole-brain
  neural dynamics by exploring the effects of stimulation of specific neurons on the
  overall state of brain calcium activity. NeuroPAL is used to obtain labels for neurons
  which are then matched to the GCaMP time series data to get quantified calcium activity
  with associated cell ID labels.


  Contents:


  Subject (C. elegans subject) - contains relevant metadata about the experimental
  subject


  Acquisition, "NeuroPALImageRaw" (MultiChannelVolume) - contains the raw image and
  associated metadata with dimensions (X, Y, Z, C)


  Processing, "NeuroPAL", "VolumeSegmentation" (VolumeSegmentation) - contains a list
  of neuron centers and associated IDs (X, Y, Z, weight, ID)


  Processing, "NeuroPAL", "ImagingVolume" (ImagingVolume) - contains the metadata
  associated with the imaging acquisition


  Processing, "NeuroPAL", "OpticalChannelRefs" (OpticalChannelReferences) - contains
  the order of the optical channels in the image


  Processing, "ProcessedImage", "Hist_match_med_filt" - contains the processed NeuroPAL
  image with dimensions (X,Y,Z,C)'
